Beyond the basics, some parks offer amenities that can turn a good stay into a great one. Think swimming pools to cool off after a day of sightseeing, on-site restaurants or cafes, and Wi-Fi to stay connected or plan your next day's adventure.

### Navigating to Your Park
Lisbon's winding streets and hilly terrain can be challenging for campervan drivers. Opt for parks that offer clear directions and possibly shuttle services to the city center, or those that are conveniently located near public transportation routes.

Embrace Lisbon's green spaces, like the expansive Monsanto Forest Park, which offers a breath of fresh air and stunning views over the city. The Jardim Botânico Tropical is another must-visit for eco-tourists, showcasing Portugal's commitment to biodiversity and conservation.

### Supporting Local and Sustainable Businesses
Lisbon is home to an array of eco-conscious businesses, from farm-to-table restaurants to shops selling locally made, sustainable goods. Supporting these establishments not only enhances your travel experience but also contributes to the local economy in a positive way.
